# Call Center Dashboard

In this project, I created a dashboard in Power BI for the call center manager, reflecting all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics using the dataset provided by PwC.


# Project Aims to analyze
* Overall customer satisfaction
* Overall calls answered/abandoned
* Calls by time
* Average speed of answer
* Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

 The goal is to gain valuable insights into call center performance, customer satisfaction, and emerging trends.
